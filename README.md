# Smart-Dustbin-with-Automatic-Waste-Separation
This project automatically separates dry and wet waste using a moisture sensor.   An IR sensor detects the presence of waste, and a servo motor rotates to direct   the waste into the correct bin (wet or dry). The OLED display shows system   status messages.

How It Works:
IR Sensor → Detects if someone places waste near the bin.
Moisture Sensor → Reads the moisture level of the waste.
Low value → Wet waste
High value → Dry waste
Servo Motor → Rotates left or right to drop waste into the correct compartment.
OLED Display → Shows system status and developer name.
